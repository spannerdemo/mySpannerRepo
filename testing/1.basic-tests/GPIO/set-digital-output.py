# This example will set one of our Testboard's outputs, first to HIGH, and then
# to LOW.
#
# The goal of this example is to show you how you can drive a digital input on
# your device from the Testboard.
#
# In our particular example, we are only setting value and not asserting
# anything. Of course this would never be a real world example, it's only for
# educational purposes
