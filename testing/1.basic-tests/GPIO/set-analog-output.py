# This example will set one of our Testboard's outputs, which has a DAC
# controller that allows it to output an analog value of anywhere from 0 to
# 3.3V.
#
# The goal of this example is to show you how you can drive an analog input on
# your device from the Testboard.
#
# In our particular example, we are only setting a value and not asserting
# anything. Of course this would never be a real world example, it's only for
# educational purposes

    # where the DAC1 output is.
    # In this example, let's say we want to give out 2V. Our analogWrite value
    # can be from 0 to 4095, which corresponds to a range of 0-3.3V. By doing
    # the calculation (2/3.3*4096), we get a value of about 2482.
