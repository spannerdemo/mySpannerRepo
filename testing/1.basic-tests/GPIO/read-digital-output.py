# This example will test two of our Product's outputs, to make sure that one is
# high, and the other one is low.
#
# The goal of this example is to show you how you can read a simple digital
# output from your device, and how you can assert boolean values.
#
# In our particular example, we expect the pin we're connecting to our
# Testboard's D5 to be always LOW, and the pin we're connecting to our
# Testboard's D7 to be always HIGH. Of course this would never be a real world
# example, it's only for educational purposes
#
# If you want to replicate this setup, you can use our Particle Photon Testboard
# and connect the D5 pin to GND, and the D7 pin to 3V3.
