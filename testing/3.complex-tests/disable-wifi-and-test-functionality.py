# This example will test the functionality of our device when we shut down the
# WiFi network. That's important because it's one of the core functionalities
# of our device, and it's one of the unique environmental inputs that our
# testing infrastructure allows when testing a product.
#
# In this particular example the device we are testing is a Smart Switch, which
# responds by toggling one of its pins On of Off whenever the user manually
# presses the button on the device..
#
# Our Testboard is acting as the Access Point that provides network connectivity
# to our device. So by turning off the Access Point our device should get into
# Network Discovery mode. However, it should still operate properly.
#
# The goal of this example is to show you how you can control more exotic (but
# absolutely critical) "inputs" in a test. Besides sensors, inputs and outputs,
# the network connectivity is an important part of the environment that needs to
# be mocked/tested in a functional test.
#
# This is one real world example of a complex, but realistic, functional test
# you would run for your devices.
#
# Note: To use this example a special Testboard that can operate in Access Point
# mode is required.
